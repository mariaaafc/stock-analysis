## Summary

Refactoring a code is advantageous as it cleans up the code, making it easier to read and understand, as well as allows someone to identify and fix any bugs. It allows individuals to restructure the code without altering the way it behaves. However, refactoring can be time consuming, especially when working with lengthy code. It can also introduce bugs in the case that an error is accidentally written into it.
